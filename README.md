Website for Olin College of Engineering "From Dirt to Shirt" Class

Want to help?
I'm at anusha@students.olin.edu. the things left to do are:

- This looks pretty bad on phones. There's probably some magic you can do with the viewport to make it less bag
- Putting some sort of logo in the corner would not be a bad idea
- Could be nice to make padding consistent
- An image gallery or slideshow could be really nice, maybe at the top of the 
about page if it's too busy on the homepage.
- Speaking of images, it would be nice to do something nice with all the pictures from various class activities, shoving them in a slideshow is easy.
- Once everyone has turned in their stories, load all of the content
- Make the content pages look pretty and deliberate
